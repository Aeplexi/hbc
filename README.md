# The Homebrew Channel
[![Build HBC](https://github.com/Aeplexi/hbc/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Aeplexi/hbc/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Included portions:

* The Homebrew Channel
* Reload stub
* Banner
* PyWii (includes Alameda for banner creation)
* WiiPAX (LZMA executable packer)

Not included:

* Installer

This has been tested on a real Wii, a Wii mini, and a vWii (Wii U).

## Build instructions

You need devkitPPC and libogc installed, and the DEVKITPRO/DEVKITPPC environment
variables correctly set. Use the latest available versions. Make sure you also install these libraries:

* libogc
* libfat
* zlib
* libpng
* mxml
* freetype

You can obtain binaries of those with
[devkitPro pacman](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman). Simply use

    sudo (dkp-)pacman -S ppc-zlib ppc-libpng ppc-mxml ppc-freetype wii-dev

Additionally, you'll need the following packages on your host machine:

* pycryptodomex (for PyWii)
* libpng headers (libpng-dev)
* gettext
* sox

The build process has only been tested on Linux. You're on your own if you
want to try building this on OSX or Windows.

First run 'make' in wiipax, then 'make' in channel. You'll find a .wad file
that you can install or directly run with Dolphin under
channel/title/channel_retail.wad. You'll also find executable binaries under
channel/channelapp, but be advised that the NAND save file / theme storage
features won't work properly if HBC isn't launched as a channel with its
correct title identity/permissions.
